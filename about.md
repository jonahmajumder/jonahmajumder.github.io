<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I grew up in the small and scenic town of Williamstown, Massachusetts. Maybe because of the large amount of green open space, I came to love all things outdoors. I attended Mt. Greylock Regional High School, where I captained soccer, tennis, and cross-country ski teams.</p>

<p>After graduating, I left Williamstown for New Haven, Connecticut and Yale. Playing sports quickly became an important part of my college life, though not at the varsity level. I joined a club soccer team that allowed me to keep playing competitively and left me with enduring frienships. I enthusiastically represented my residential college, Branford, in nearly every intramural sport, from basketball to badminton.</p>

<p>Beyond sports, I love to hike and to ride my bike. For two summers in college, I led bike tours for a company called <a href="https://overlandsummers.com/" target="_blank">Overland</a>. I spent these idyllic summers with a co-leader and twelve teenagers, first in Cape Cod, then in Nova Scotia, We rode from campground to campground, bringing only what we could carry on the back of our bikes. Below are two of my favorite pictures from Nova Scotia (click for full size versions).</p>

<p>At Yale, I majored in physics and economics. Early on, I knew that I wanted to use science and technology to help make the world a better place. After exploring a few different options, I decided that medicine (and an MD-PhD) was the best way for me to do this.</p>

<p>I graduated in the spring of 2017 and began working in applied physics research at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Simultaneously, I kept preparing to for medical school, taking evening classes, studying for the MCAT, and completing applications. At Lincoln Lab, I was lucky to have great mentors and exciting research projects (read about them <a href="research">here</a>).</p>

<p>This past spring, I formally resigned from my job, excited to soon start an MD-PhD at <a href="https://www.ps.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons</a>. The global pandemic put an end to any grand travel plans, but I was able to enjoy a relaxing break filled with socially-distanced outdoor activities (like hiking and tennis).</p>

<p>In August, I became a (remote) first-year medical student, learning over Zoom, from the comfort of my parents' garage. I look forward to moving to New York City this spring, as Columbia begins the transition back to an in-person curriculum.</p>
